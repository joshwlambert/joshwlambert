# Hi :wave: 

I'm Josh, an evolutionary biologist 🧬 🐸, turned research software engineer 💻.

I'm currently working at the [The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) on the [Epiverse initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/), and finishing my PhD at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en). My PhD is on the topic of developing novel phylogenetic models to understand macroevolutionary patterns on islands ⛰️.
