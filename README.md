# Hi :wave: 

I'm Josh, an evolutionary biologist 🧬 🐸, turned research software engineer 💻.

I'm currently working at the [The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) on the [Epiverse initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/), and finishing my PhD at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en). My PhD is on the topic of developing novel phylogenetic models to understand macroevolutionary patterns on islands ⛰️.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Epiverse by day, macroevolution and island biogeography by night.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: most things, but mainly epidemiology of infectious diseases.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: interesting research questions at the intersection of evolutionary biology and epidemiology.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: not sure ... but fun collaborators are always welcome 😃
- 💬 Ask me about: anything!
